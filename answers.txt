To visit relatives in Japan, you need a valid passport, an application form with a recent facial photo (4.5Ã—3.5 cm), and documents proving your relationship (such as birth or marriage certificates). Additionally, you must submit a birth certificate issued by PSA within one year. If the birth certificate is unreadable or not available, alternative documents like those from a Local Civil Registrar may be required.

The requirements for tourism if you have a guarantor to shoulder your expenses include a Guarantee Letter, proof of relationship between the applicant and the guarantor (such as birth certificates or photos), a Bank Certificate, a photocopy of the Tax Payment Certificate, and an Employment Certificate.

The requirements for a nikkei-jin Japan visa include: a valid passport, an application form with a facial photo, a request for a multiple-entry visa, a PSA-issued birth certificate and marriage certificate (for married applicants), an itinerary in Japan, and a bank certificate showing the applicant's balance over the last six months. Additional documents may be required based on specific circumstances related to the birth or marriage records. For complete details, refer to the official website.
